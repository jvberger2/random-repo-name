# X-Team 25 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will each pick any parts that we wish to work on. Ties between group members 
and chosen tasks will be broken and assigned by the group leader.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will stay on track by using self imposed deadlines, assigned at the start of our 
project, to make sure each group member is on track. Enforced by the group leader.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

By making use of our group chat to communicate any problems to our group members.
So that we can help each other find solutions.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Offer help to anyone who needs it and by having our own deadlines in advance of the 
final ones so that if a member is unable to finish his part the group will have time 
to step in and assist them.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Comment and commits of your code so its clear what your code is doing.
Have fun.
